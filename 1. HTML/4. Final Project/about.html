			Hey there! I'm nobody in particular, a programmer, tech enthusiast, and all-around curious mind from
			Concordia, Entre
			Ríos,
			Argentina. I've dived deep into the world of IT, focusing on coding and robotic process automation. I
			graduated as a
			Superior Technician in Programming from UTN and as a University Technician in Web Development from UNER. Oh,
			and I can
			navigate through TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java—basically, if it's code, I'm on it. Also, did you know
			that
			Argentina has more psychologists per capita than any other country? Wild, right?<br><br>

			Beyond the screen, music is my second language. You'll probably find me jamming on my electric or acoustic
			guitar,
			tinkering on the piano, or maybe rating another album on my meticulously detailed music log. Speaking of
			which, Counting
			Crows at Woodstock '99—best live performance ever. No debate. I'm also working toward mastering the solo of
			'Stricken'
			by Disturbed, and I'm on a mission to write a full album by the end of the year. Oh, and I listen to entire
			albums—none
			of that shuffle nonsense.<br><br>

			I'm also building this idea called 'GamesBrainz'—think MusicBrainz but for video games. Metadata is kind of
			my thing. I
			keep all sorts of lists: games I've beaten, albums I've heard (rated 0-100, of course), even guitars I've
			played.
			Sometimes I wonder if I should list all the lists I have. Would that be... meta? Hmm.<br><br>

			When I'm not lost in code or music, I'm diving into history, war stories, or the occasional mystery.
			Paranormal stuff
			too. Like, have you ever smelled something that isn't there? My grandmother's perfume sometimes lingers,
			and—well,
			that's a story for another time.<br><br>

			Travel is always on my mind. I'd love to explore Japan—especially its ancient temples, mountain villages,
			and those
			relaxing onsens. But my curiosity doesn't stop there. South Korea's vibrant city life, Taiwan's night
			markets, and
			China's historical landmarks are calling too. Maybe even a detour to Vietnam or Thailand for their rich
			history and
			landscapes. Until then, I'll settle for mate before and after dinner—it's the little things.<br><br>

			Lately, I'm on a mission to learn Japanese (N3 this year, fingers crossed) and maybe pick up another
			language because
			why not? Oh, and I'm getting back into fitness—slowly but surely. I used to walk 6 km regularly, but now I'm
			easing back
			with shorter walks and home workouts. Gotta balance all that coding and music with some movement,
			right?<br><br>

			So, that's me—kind of. A programmer, musician, history buff, list-maker, and occasional philosopher. Oh, and
			if you need
			someone to debate politics or just talk about how underrated certain anime are, I'm your person.<br><br>

			Hit me up if you wanna chat, or something.
