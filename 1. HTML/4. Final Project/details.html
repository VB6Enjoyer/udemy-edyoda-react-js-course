			They call it Somewhere. No one recalls who named it that, or if it ever had another name. It's the kind of
			place you
			stumble upon rather than arrive at—the roads seem to lead there on their own accord, winding in ways that
			maps don't
			account for. The air hums differently here, neither warm nor cold, as though it hasn't quite decided what it
			wants to
			be.<br><br>

			The skyline blurs, an uneven mix of hills that might be mountains and buildings that might be trees. Shadows
			stretch
			longer than they should, casting shapes that seem vaguely familiar but refuse to settle into anything
			recognizable.
			Locals—if they can be called that—drift through the cobbled streets with knowing smiles, their eyes holding
			stories they
			won't tell. Shops open and close without pattern; signs swing in breezes that never quite touch your
			skin.<br><br>

			In one corner, a clock tower ticks backward, or perhaps sideways—no one bothers to check. Somewhere's market
			smells
			faintly of spices you've never tasted but swear you've known forever. Lanterns sway above narrow alleys that
			widen when
			you're not looking, leading to plazas that weren't there the day before.<br><br>

			You might hear music—or laughter—from behind a door that won't open again if you leave. And there's a
			bridge, or maybe a
			pier, that vanishes into a fog too thin to be real. People say it leads to Elsewhere, though no one agrees
			on where that
			is.<br><br>

			Stay long enough, and you might find yourself remembering things you've never done. Or was it dreaming? But
			that doesn't
			matter much here. In Somewhere, everything feels on the verge of happening, or perhaps has already
			happened—it's hard to
			say.<br><br>

			And yet, you stay. Because in Somewhere, leaving feels a bit like forgetting—and who would want that?
